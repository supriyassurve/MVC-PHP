MVC-PHP-BASE is a framework and still under construction and not completed as per the MVC pattern.
The framework will be as per the rails framework for ruby.

Need to work on Bugs like :
  If try to call view without php extenstion it works fine, but with php extention it crashes.
  Missing the actual flow of MVC (model, views and controller).
